            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Akash Pasumarthi, an ambitious, multi-tasking analytical thinker with the ability to work in a fast-paced work environment and capable of picking up new skills quickly. My interest lies in the field of Data Engineering, Data Analytics, Data Visualization, and Database development. I enjoy contributing new Ideas and I am a good team player.
            With 9 years of experience as an Azure Data Engineer, I bring extensive expertise in developing and maintaining scalable data pipelines, implementing data quality processes, and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to build robust data architectures.
            In my current role, I have been responsible for maintaining and operating data warehouses, integrating diverse data sources, and developing ETL pipelines to support growing data volumes and complexities. I have successfully implemented automated monitoring, alerting, and self-healing features, ensuring high availability and accuracy of production data. My experience in data modeling, data warehousing, and building consumption pipelines has equipped me with the skills necessary to excel. 
            My daily responsibilities include writing unit and integration tests, documenting work, and contributing to engineering wikis. I have a proven track record of defining and populating company data models and working with various business units to develop long-term data platform strategies. My ability to communicate effectively with engineering, product, and business teams has been instrumental in developing data solutions that address key business questions and drive informed decision-making.
            I am self-motivated, detail-oriented, and possess strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills. My inquisitive nature drives me to ask the right questions and dig deeper to understand underlying issues. I am passionate about learning and continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise.
            My technical skills include extensive experience with the Python data stack, deploying and managing data pipelines in the cloud, and working with technologies like Airflow, Hadoop, and Spark. I also have a solid understanding of streaming technologies such as Kafka and Spark Streaming. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, which has provided me with a strong foundation in quantitative analysis and data engineering principles.
